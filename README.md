## Game Leaflet

__An arcade game where you must survive by stealing lifeforce from the mortals of the realm of the living.__

If the web player is laggy, download the executable for your system, it should perform better.

### Description:

 - You're a reaper and you're losing lifeforce,  so you must take it from the mortals of the realm of the living. But there is a catch, your life drains quicker from manifesting yourself in their reality - so you must use your compass to trace them before crossing over and harvesting their life force.

 - Beware, mortals who you steal life force from will haunt you in the realm of the dead, so watch out.

 - The red arrow that appears around you in the realm of the dead (monochrome) is the compass that points to humans in the living world.

### Controls:
 - Space to switch realms
 - Left click to smite
 - Escape to pause

### Updates
 - Removed bugs
 - Improved WebGL performance and performance across all builds
 - Made the game easier, as requested, (more humans, slower ghosts)

### Bugs (All fixed now):
 - [FIXED] Sometimes humans won't spawn for a game: this is fixed by pausing, exiting to the main menu and starting the game again; or restarting the program.
